## BAM
The `prefix.bam` file contains clipped records, annotated with barcode tags,
that passed filters.


### Read group
Each barcode pair is represented by one read group @RG header line, with the `DS` tag
containing optionally those items

|      Key       |                                                Value spec                                                 |          Value example           |
| :------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| BarcodeFile    | Name of the Fasta file containing the sequences of the barcodes used.                                     | pacbio_384_barcodes.fasta        |
| BarcodeHash    | The MD5 hash of the contents of the barcoding sequence file, as generated by the md5sum commandline tool. | 0a294bb959fc6c766967fc8beeb4d88d |
| BarcodeCount   | The number of barcode sequences in the Barcode File.                                                      | 384                              |
| BarcodeMode    | Experimental design of the barcodes. Must be Symmetric/Asymmetric/Tailed or None.                         | Symmetric                        |
| BarcodeQuality | The type of value encoded by the bq tag. Must be Score/Probability/None.                                  | Probability                      |

### Read tags

| Tag  | Type  |                                         Description                                          |
| :--: | :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bc` | `B,S` | Barcode pair indices, integer codes represent 0-based position in the FASTA file of barcodes |
| `bq` | `i`   | Barcode score / quality, normalized between 0 and 100                                        |
| `bl` | `Z`   | Barcode sequence clipped from leading end                                                    |
| `bt` | `Z`   | Barcode sequence clipped from trailing end                                                   |
| `ql` | `Z`   | Qualities of barcode bases clipped from leading end, stored as a FASTQ string                |
| `qt` | `Z`   | Qualities of barcode bases clipped from trailing end, stored as a FASTQ string               |
| `bx` | `B,i` | Pair of clipped barcode sequence lengths                                                     |

## DataSet
One DataSet, SubreadSet or ConsensusReadset, is generated per output BAM file.

## PBI
One PBI file is generated per output BAM file.
